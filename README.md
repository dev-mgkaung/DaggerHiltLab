# DaggerHiltLab

This is a demo app built using 'Hilt' a new dependency injection framework for Android.

#### The app has following packages:
1. **data**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **di**: It contains the files required by Dagger
3. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.
4. **utils**: Utility classes.

## Android Development and Architecture

* The entire codebase is in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* Uses Kotlin [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html)
* Uses MVVM Architecture by [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/). Room, LiveData, ViewModel
* Uses [Hilt Android](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) with [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) for dependency injection
